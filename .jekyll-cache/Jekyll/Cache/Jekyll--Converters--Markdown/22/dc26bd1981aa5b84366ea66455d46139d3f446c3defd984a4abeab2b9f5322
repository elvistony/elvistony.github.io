I"Ì<p>Windows, has been the only operating system Iâ€™ve used since I was 5, until last year. I still remember that Grey vibe of Windows 98. That soon was upgraded to Windows XP (called Windows Xperience by the community). To be completely honest with Yâ€™all, Iâ€™ve probably boot-looped about 10 systems when I was a kid. That sure was a hell lotta scolding, coz it was always Mom to the rescue, there werenâ€™t many Computer Engineers back in those times.</p>
