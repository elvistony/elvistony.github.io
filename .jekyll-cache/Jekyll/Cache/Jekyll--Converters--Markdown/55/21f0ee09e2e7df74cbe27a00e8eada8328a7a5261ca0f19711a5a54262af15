I"ñ<p><em>A Simple Guide on Installing KDE Neon on your System. If you are a programmer, Linux is for you.</em></p>

<p>Installing Linux is pretty straight forward almost as easy as installing Windows.In this guide Iâ€™ll be helping yâ€™all install  a linux flavour based on Ubuntu.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">KDE neon is the intersection of these needs using a stable Ubuntu long-term release as its core, packaging the hottest software fresh from the KDE Community ovens.</p>

<p>Before getting started with the Installation,We need to know a tiny difference of Linux and Windows Installation is the distribution of the System Files.</p>

<p>In Windows, the system files are stored in the Windows-Basic-Partition (Local Disk C:) in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:/Windows</code> and the User files in  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:/Users/</code>`</p>

<p>In Linux, the system files are stored in the Root Drive in Global Root/ and the User files in /home</p>
