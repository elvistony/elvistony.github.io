<p>Installing Linux is pretty straight forward almost as easy as installing Windows.In this guide I’ll be helping y’all install  a linux flavour based on Ubuntu.</p>

<p class="notice--success">KDE neon is the intersection of these needs using a stable Ubuntu long-term release as its core, packaging the hottest software fresh from the KDE Community ovens.
Before getting started with the Installation,We need to know a tiny difference of Linux and Windows Installation is the distribution of the System Files.</p>

<p>In Windows, the system files are stored in the Windows-Basic-Partition (Local Disk C:) in C:/Windows and the User files in C:/Users/</p>

<p>In Linux, the system files are stored in the Root Drive in Global Root/ and the User files in /home</p>
