So, you want to host one of this for your class, you've come to the right place.

## What is this Web-app?

The timetable web-app is a simple app to display the day's Class Timetable.

It supports the publishing of alternate schedules or fall-back to the regular timetable all in the control of an easy to use Google Form. The app also features Google Account pre-selection, Dark Mode and also a Notification when its time for the next Period!

## Assumptions
I'm gonna assume a few things here,
 - You know how to use Github.
 - You have an account in Github.
 - You know basics of programming (optional).
 - You know how to make Google Forms and Google Sheet Responses.

## Hosting

### Forking my Repository
Head over to Github.com and fork my repository.

<a href="https://github.com/elvistony/time-table" target="_blank" class="btn btn--warning">github.com/elvistony/..</a>

In your fork, be sure to enable Github pages for your branch. To enable Gh-pages navigate to :

`Settings > Github Pages > Select Branch`

Wait for Github to respond with 

`Your site is published at ..../time-table/`

Click the link and See if the Deployment is successful and the page loads correctly or not.
