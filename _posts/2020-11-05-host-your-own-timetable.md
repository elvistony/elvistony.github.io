So, you want to host one of this for your class, you've come to the right place.

## What is this Web-app?

The timetable web-app is a simple app to display the day's Class Timetable.

It supports the publishing of alternate schedules or fall-back to the regular timetable all in the control of an easy to use Google Form. The app also features Google Account pre-selection, Dark Mode and also a Notification when its time for the next Period!

## Assumptions
I'm gonna assume a few things here,
 - You know how to use Github
 - You have an account in Github
 - You know basics of programming (optional)
 - You know how to make Google Forms and Google Sheet Responses
