Dark Mode is something everyone would fall for today, especially when the rise of Computer Screen time increases.

Here's a tiny Javascript code that makes your Google Meet - forcefully use a Dark Theme.

`Note: This does not enable dark mode for the participants of the meet.`

Now you can enable this in two ways!

 - Temporarily for a particular Meeting
 - Globally for all of your Google Meetings

#### Temporary Setup

Head over to [Dark Meet JS](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-dark)

Open the [Javascript File](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-dark/blob/master/js/darkmode.js)
and copy the entire code.

In your Google Meet tab, open the Console using `Ctrl+Shift+i` and select the `console` tab.

Paste the code there and press enter.

In 2 seconds the Google Meet should now toggle to the new Dark Mode!

#### Permanant Solution

This is done using a third-party extension that injects Javascript. You are free to use your own. 

I use [Custom JavaScript for websites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija?hl=en) - Chrome Extension.

Install the Extension and Reload the Meeting Tab to enable the Extension on the domain.

`Woah Woah....this post is not sponsored by any third-party application!...okay?`

Head over to [Dark Meet JS](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-dark)

Open the [Javascript File](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-dark/blob/master/js/darkmode.js)
and copy the entire code.

and Switch to the Meet Tab and click the CJS.

Paste the Javascript Code and click Save.

This should now work whenever you open a meeting in the browser.

Stay Tuned for more!
