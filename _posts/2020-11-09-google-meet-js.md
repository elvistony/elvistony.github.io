Google Meet is something we've all used especially after everyone had to stay indoors. Its one of the most polished interfaces out there, but with a few little tweaks, it could be a tad bit more interesting!

Here's a tiny piece of code that could make your google meet experience a tad bit better!

Now you can enable this in two ways!

 - Temporarily for a particular Browser tab
 - Permanantly for all Google Meets in the browser.

#### Temporary Setup

Installation
- Head over to [Google Meet Addons](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-addons)  
- Select the Set you'd like to apply and navigate to that Documentation.
- Here, I'll take [Dark Mode Minimal](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-addons/tree/master/dark-mode-minimal)
- In your browser, create a new bookmark
- In the URL portion, Enter the long code:
_Triple click on the code to select the whole_
- Name the Bookmark as anything you wish.
- Voila! Its ready!

Usage
- Launch your Google Meet
- While keeping the current meet tab open, press the Bookmark we made.
- After a few seconds, you'll see the difference.

#### Permanant Solution

Installation
- Head over to [Google Meet Addons](https://github.com/elvistony/meet-addons)  
- Select the Set you'd like to apply and navigate to that JS File.
- Copy all the code of the JS File.
- Install a Chrome Addon/ Firefox Addon like CustomJavaScript
- Open a google Meet session and click the CustomJavaScript extension.
- Paste the code into the extension's window.
- And voila! its done!

Usage
- Nothing much, Just open your meeting and it should activate automatically!
