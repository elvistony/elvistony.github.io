**My Raspberry Pi "Port Key": A Magical Gateway to Any Network Region!**  

As a big fan of Harry Potter and a tech enthusiast, I couldn‚Äôt resist combining my love for both into a fun little hobby project. Inspired by the concept of Portkeys in the wizarding world‚Äîobjects that instantly teleport you to another location‚ÄîI built my very own **network Port Key**. It‚Äôs not enchanted, of course, but thanks to a Raspberry Pi, a USB Wi-Fi adapter, and some VPN wizardry, it makes my devices feel like they‚Äôre teleported to different countries with the flick of a virtual wand.  

### The Problem That Started It All  

Let me set the stage. I use Surfshark VPN on my devices, including my TV. It‚Äôs fantastic for accessing region-locked content and staying under the radar from the ever-growing world of online tracking and ads. But my TV (a bit of a Muggle, to be honest) kept killing the VPN process in the background. Annoying, right? I mean, one second I‚Äôm in the US bingeing my favorite TV shows, and the next, the VPN drops, and I‚Äôm kicked back to my local network.  

That frustration got me thinking: *Why not take the burden off my TV and create a centralized VPN hotspot instead?*  

### Enter the Raspberry Pi  

Armed with a Raspberry Pi Model A+ and a trusty USB Wi-Fi adapter, I got to work. The goal? Create a portable network hub where any device‚Äîbe it my TV, laptop, or phone‚Äîcould connect and instantly ‚Äúteleport‚Äù to a specific country‚Äôs network.  

I set up **OpenVPN with Surfshark** to handle the heavy lifting of connecting to different regions. A simple **Flask app** serves as the control panel, letting me switch regions effortlessly. Want to watch a show exclusive to Japan? A few taps, and voil√†, my network says ‚ÄúKon‚Äônichiwa!‚Äù Prefer a Show in the US? Easy‚Äîjust select the US option, and I‚Äôm virtually there.  

The cherry on top? When all VPNs are off, the network falls back to regular Wi-Fi, so I‚Äôm not stuck in VPN limbo when I don‚Äôt need it.  

### Why This Matters in Today‚Äôs World  

As fun as this project was, it‚Äôs rooted in something more important: privacy and freedom. These days, everything and everyone seems to be tracking us. From targeted ads that eerily know you *too* well to websites limiting content based on your location, the digital world feels more like Big Brother than Hogwarts.  

Using a VPN helps you take back some of that control. It hides your real location, encrypts your internet traffic, and makes it much harder for advertisers, trackers, and even your ISP to keep tabs on you. For me, this project isn‚Äôt just about unlocking region-locked content‚Äîit‚Äôs about protecting my digital footprint while enjoying the internet on *my* terms.  

### How It Works  

Here‚Äôs the TL;DR of my setup:  
1. **Raspberry Pi Model A+**: The brain of my Port Key.  
2. **USB Wi-Fi Adapter**: Creates a Wi-Fi access point for my devices.  
3. **OpenVPN with Surfshark**: Handles VPN connections to different regions.  
4. **Flask App**: Acts as a control panel to switch regions or turn off the VPN entirely.  
5. **Fallback Wi-Fi**: When VPNs are off, it defaults to regular internet.  

This setup offloads the VPN processing from individual devices (like my moody TV) and provides a seamless way to switch countries on the fly.  

### Surfshark
Surfshark has been pretty solid in performance for me and I'd genuinely recommend it if you're out for a VPN provider! Here's a link to get a good deal on Surfshark! [Surfshark Referral](https://surfshark.club/friend/N63LWHmW)

### Final Thoughts  

Creating my network Port Key has been one of my favorite projects‚Äîit‚Äôs useful, fun, and gives me a little slice of wizardry in the tech world. Plus, it‚Äôs a reminder of how important it is to stay mindful of our online privacy.  

So if you‚Äôre a tinkerer like me or just tired of dealing with VPNs on individual devices, give something like this a try! Who says you need magic when you have a Raspberry Pi? ü™Ñ  

Now, if only I could figure out how to make this thing *actually* teleport me to another country... üëÄ  

Would you try building a network Port Key of your own? Let me know your thoughts!
