<h3 class="">About me</h3>
  <p class="text--large"><em>I'm Elvis Tony,</em></p>
  <p>I'm often come across as a silent, unnoticed being. It <i>kinda</i> takes time in breaking the shell. But I've heard, I can be a pest to some (If you manage to Break the Ice).
      This blog is about everything I can think of, it includes my hobbies, thoughts, guides, and so much more!</p>
